# Simple isomorphic react-boilerplate

Trying to understand isomorphic webapps and is tired of "Simple boilerplates" with 200 MB of code?
This is a REALLY simple boilerplate with as few confusing elements as possible. Uses react, react-router and express.
Builds the client with gulp and runs the server through npm


## Start

### Run

```
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. open browser at localhost:3000

```

### Build client only
```
gulp

```
